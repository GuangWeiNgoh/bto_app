        The HDB Resale Transactions Explorer is a web application designed to facilitate the exploration and analysis of 
        Housing Development Board (HDB) resale flat transactions in Singapore. The application provides users with an 
        interactive interface to view, filter, and visualize resale data spanning from 1990 to the present. By leveraging 
        data from (https://data.gov.sg/), the official government data portal for Singapore, the project aims to enhance public access to real estate information, aiding potential buyers, 
        researchers, and policy-makers in their decision-making processes.

        - **Data Loading and Caching:** The application first checks for a locally stored ZIP file containing the dataset. 
        If it exists, it loads the data from the ZIP file; otherwise, it fetches the latest data from the API. The fetched 
        data is serialized and stored in a ZIP file using a highly compressed format to optimize storage.
        
        - **Data Visualization:** 
            - **Bar Charts:** Users can view average resale prices by town and flat type using Altair bar charts, providing 
            a visual representation of market conditions.
            - **Line Chart:** The application also features a line chart illustrating how average resale prices change over 
            the years.
        
        - **Dynamic Filtering:** Users can select specific years, months, towns, flat types, storey ranges, and other 
        attributes to filter the dataset dynamically. Sliders allow for range selections on numeric values such as 
        floor area, remaining lease, lease commence date, and resale price.
        
        - **User Interface Elements:** Interactive buttons and message placeholders guide users in updating data and provide 
        feedback (e.g., success messages) regarding actions taken. The application employs a responsive layout using 
        Streamlit columns to organize the filter options efficiently.
        
        - **Error Handling:** The application includes error handling to manage issues such as failed data fetch attempts, 
        ensuring a robust user experience.
        
        - **Session State Management:** The use of Streamlit‚Äôs session state enables the application to maintain user 
        selections and data across interactions, enhancing usability.
